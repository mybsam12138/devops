# Why Use Multiple Subnets in One VPC

In cloud architecture, even when all resources are deployed inside a
single **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**, architects usually divide the
network into several **subnets**, such as:

- Public Subnet
- Management Subnet
- Service Subnet
- Data Subnet
- Desktop Subnet

This design improves **security, traffic control, scalability, and architecture clarity**.

---

# 1. Security Isolation

Different layers of a system require different security levels.

Example:

| Subnet | Typical Components | Access Policy |
|------|--------------------|--------------|
| Public Subnet | Load Balancer | Accessible from Internet |
| Service Subnet | Application services | Only accessible internally |
| Data Subnet | Databases, Redis | Only accessible from Service Subnet |
| Desktop Subnet | Cloud desktop VMs | Controlled through gateway |
| Management Subnet | Monitoring, Logging, Admin tools | Admin-only access |

This prevents sensitive resources such as **databases** from being directly exposed to the internet.

---

# 2. Traffic Control Between Subnets

Subnets allow architects to control **which parts of the system can communicate**.

Example policy:

| Source Subnet | Destination Subnet | Allowed |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Public Subnet | Service Subnet | Yes |
| Public Subnet | Data Subnet | No |
| Service Subnet | Data Subnet | Yes |
| Desktop Subnet | Service Subnet | Yes |
| Desktop Subnet | Data Subnet | No |

This limits **lateral movement** if a machine becomes compromised.

---

# 3. Clear Architecture Layering

Subnets usually represent **different architecture layers** of a system.

Example structure:

```
VPC
├── Public Subnet (Load Balancer / Gateway)
├── Management Subnet (Monitoring / Logging / Admin tools)
├── Service Subnet (Backend services)
├── Desktop Subnet (Virtual desktop VMs)
└── Data Subnet (Database / Cache)
```

This separation makes the system easier to **design, operate, and troubleshoot**.

---

# 4. Routing Control

Each subnet can use different **route tables**.

Example:

| Subnet | Internet Access |
|------|----------------|
| Public Subnet | Yes |
| Service Subnet | No |
| Data Subnet | No |
| Desktop Subnet | Limited |
| Management Subnet | Restricted |

This ensures only specific components can access the **internet or external networks**.

---

# 5. Fault and Risk Isolation

If one part of the system is compromised or misconfigured, subnet isolation helps limit the impact.

Example:

- A compromised desktop VM cannot directly access the database.
- A public-facing server cannot reach internal management tools.

This reduces the risk of **large-scale security breaches**.

---

# 6. IP Address Management

Subnets help organize IP allocation inside a VPC.

Example:

VPC CIDR: `10.0.0.0/16`

| Subnet | CIDR |
|------|------|
| Public Subnet | 10.0.1.0/24 |
| Management Subnet | 10.0.2.0/24 |
| Service Subnet | 10.0.3.0/24 |
| Desktop Subnet | 10.0.4.0/22 |
| Data Subnet | 10.0.8.0/24 |

Different layers can reserve different IP ranges depending on scale.

# Summary

Even within a single VPC, multiple subnets are used to:

1. Provide **security isolation**
2. Control **network communication paths**
3. Organize **system architecture layers**
4. Apply different **routing policies**
5. Improve **fault isolation**
6. Manage **IP allocation efficiently**

Subnets turn a large flat network into a **structured and secure architecture**.

# When Do You Need Kubernetes?

> **Kubernetes is justified by operational complexity, not by hype or scale alone.**

This document summarizes *when Kubernetes makes sense* and *when it is likely overkill*, based on first principles and real-world usage.

---

## 1. The Core Decision Principle

Kubernetes is needed when:

> **You need a control plane to ma
> nage multiple machines and application instances consistently.**

It is *not* triggered by:
- Microservices
- Cloud-native trends
- Containerization alone

It *is* triggered by:
- High availability
- Multi-node coordination
- Reliable deployment and recovery

---

## 2. Single Node Scenario

### Typical characteristics
- One VM or physical server
- Manual restart is acceptable
- Downtime is tolerable
- Simple Docker or systemd-based deployment

### Kubernetes verdict

❌ **Usually not necessary**

Reasons:
- No scheduling problem
- No failover problem
- No service discovery problem
- Docker + scripts are often sufficient

> Kubernetes adds cognitive and operational overhead with limited return.

---

## 3. Multiple Nodes Scenario (Key Turning Point)

### Typical characteristics
- Two or more nodes
- Need for high availability
- Need for load balancing
- Node or process failure must be handled automatically

### Kubernetes verdict

✅ **Strongly recommended**

Reasons:
- Automatic scheduling
- Self-healing via controllers
- Built-in service discovery
- Declarative deployment model

> Once you have multiple nodes, you are already operating a distributed system.

---

## 4. Environment-Based Perspective (Very Common Case)

### Typical setup

| Environment | Nodes |
|------------|------|
| Dev | 1 |
| UAT / Test | 1 |
| Prod | 3+ |

### Kubernetes verdict

✅ **Yes, Kubernetes makes sense**

Why:
- Production requires multi-node coordination
- Dev/UAT benefit from the same deployment model
- Operational consistency across environments

> Kubernetes is justified by the *hardest* environment (usually PROD).

---

## 5. Why Kubernetes Is Still Useful for Dev / UAT

Even with a single node, Kubernetes provides:

- Same Deployment / Service YAML as PROD
- Same Docker image (build once, run everywhere)
- Same rollout and restart semantics
- Same configuration model (ConfigMap / Secret)

This ensures:
- Higher confidence during promotion
- Fewer environment-specific surprises
- Easier debugging and rollback

---

## 6. What Kubernetes Does NOT Automatically Solve

Kubernetes does **not**:
- Split monoliths into microservices
- Fix poor domain boundaries
- Remove internal coupling
- Replace application architecture decisions

It focuses on **operations**, not **business design**.

---

## 7. When Kubernetes Might Be Overkill

Kubernetes is likely unnecessary if *all* of the following are true:

- Only one node in all environments
- Low traffic and low availability requirements
- Manual deployment is acceptable
- Downtime has low business impact

In such cases, simpler tools may be more appropriate.

---

## 8. A Practical Rule of Thumb

> **If any environment requires multi-node deployment or HA, Kubernetes is justified for all environments.**

Not for scale — but for **operational symmetry**.

---

## 9. One-Sentence Summary

> **Use Kubernetes when operational consistency, reliability, and automation matter more than simplicity.**

---

## 10. Recommended Adoption Path

1. Start with monolith + Kubernetes
2. Use one image across all environments
3. Scale only when needed
4. Split services only when business pressure demands it
